# What is this?
[TIGERGRAPH WEB-APP HACK OVERVIEW](https://tigergraph-web-app-hack.devpost.com/)

[TigerGraph Chat](https://discord.gg/F2c9b9v)
talk with other developers

[TigerGraph Community Forum](https://community.tigergraph.com/)
talk with TigerGraph engineers

  
**THE CHALLENGE:**

Use a [starter kit](https://www.tigergraph.com/starterkits/) to build something:  
* creative 
* that helps communicate the story of the data in the starter kit  [database materials](https://community.tigergraph.com/t/tigergraph-2020-graphathon/540)
* uses [Stremlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) as GUI, alongside dataviz tools like [graphistry](https://www.graphistry.com/) and plotly

**THE STARTER KIT:**
* 25+ options or create your own
* built with sample data schema
* dataset
* queries for specific:
  * use cases
  * industries
>TigerGraph Cloud Starter Kits (25+ Options or create your own) are built with sample graph data schema, dataset, and queries focused on a specific use case such as Fraud Detection, Recommendation Engine, Supply Chain Analysis, and/or a specific industry such as healthcare, pharmaceutical, or financial services.
