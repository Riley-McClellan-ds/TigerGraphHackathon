# Figuring Out How this Works 
[TIGERGRAPH WEB-APP HACK OVERVIEW](https://tigergraph-web-app-hack.devpost.com/)
  
**THE CHALLENGE:**

> Use a [starter kit](https://www.tigergraph.com/starterkits/) to build something:
> * creative 
> * that helps communicate the story of the data in the starter kit
> * uses [Stremlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) as GUI, alongside dataviz tools like [graphistry](https://www.graphistry.com/) and plotly

>TigerGraph Cloud Starter Kits (25+ Options or create your own) are built with sample graph data schema, dataset, and queries focused on a specific use case such as Fraud Detection, Recommendation Engine, Supply Chain Analysis, and/or a specific industry such as healthcare, pharmaceutical, or financial services.
